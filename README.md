This program generates messages that would be fed into a bigger testing suite.

### What is this repository for? ###

This was something I needed to create to speed up some testing. The original process of manually creating these messages was was very slow, tedious, and most importantly buggy! This isn't quite as effective as unit testing could be, but it saved many hours of effort and produced reliable results.

(NOTE: This has been sanitized to the point of being virtually useless, but I liked the logic behind it and really enjoyed building this so I wanted to save it off.)
